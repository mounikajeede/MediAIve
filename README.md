### MediVoice: Speech-to-Text Disease Detector
MediVoice is a  project aimed at automating medical documentation and disease detection using AI. It leverages OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text transcription and spaCy's NLP models to map symptoms to ICD-10 codes, improving healthcare efficiency and patient outcomes.

## Setup Instructions

# Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/grk1102/MediVoice.git
cd MediVoice_GitHub_File


# Install Dependencies:Create a virtual environment and install required packages:

## API Keys:

Obtain an OpenAI API key and set it in a .env file (not committed):OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here


Use a library like python-dotenv to load the key.



## Usage

Speech-to-Text: Input audio files (e.g., .wav) are transcribed using Whisper.
Disease Detection: Transcribed text is processed by spaCy to extract symptoms and map to ICD-10 codes.
Sample Data: Place audio files in data/ (excluded by .gitignore due to size).
